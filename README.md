# git_recipes
In this project I plan to put my recently aquired HTML skills to the test to create a fairly bare bones website. This project will consist of a single index.html file that will have various links to recipes that I enjoy.

Reflection: I was able to apply my newly learned HTML and CSS skills to the test with this project. It doesnt look too pretty but I was able to apply what I learned of CSS such as: basic syntax, selectors, properties, and the cascade of CSS.
